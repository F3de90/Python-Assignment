**Python-based terminal app developed as part of a university assignment.**

##Project Overview

This is a lightweight, menu-driven Library Management System written in Python. It allows staff to manage books using a local catalogue, including:

- Adding new books
- Searching by title or author
- Checking out and returning books
- Listing all books with their availability status

All data is stored in memory using Python lists and dictionaries â€” no database is needed.

##Features

- Add new books with unique ID, title, author, and publication year
- Prevent duplicate IDs or empty fields
- Year validation (between 1450 and the current year)
- Borrow and return books using the book ID
- Case-insensitive search by title or author
